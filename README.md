# Testing
This is my test repository for Codex integration.

## Animated windowed 2048

Launch the animated 2048 clone with:

```bash
python pretty_2048.py
```

A dedicated window will open with vibrant tiles that glide into place.
Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move, and tap `r` to restart at any time.
